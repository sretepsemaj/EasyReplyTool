This project, EasyReplyTool (name is open to change), is designed to help content creators better understand their audience by synthesizing feedback from the comments they receive. Try and be better than the competition and also make something for the viewers and try and keep it as free as possible. Currently, it can fetch up to 60 recent comments from the last 24 hours on a video—whichever is greater—using the Google YouTube API. It then leverages Groq (2 month left free, i talked to developers) to process these comments and generate a concise summary of the community's feedback. Each comment, along with the commenter’s name, is displayed below the summary, giving creators a clear and organized view of their audience’s responses for that day—all in one place. This simple yet powerful tool helps creators engage with their fans more meaningfully, without needing to sift through hundreds of comments.

EasyReplyTool is just the beginning. Our vision is to create a fully open-source tool that anyone can download, with the potential for a user-friendly interface if there’s enough support to cover server costs. As algorithms increasingly determine what content we see, it’s time for a new approach.

We’re building a tool that not only lets content creators connect more deeply with their audiences but also empowers users to discover unique, valuable content beyond what’s popular. Imagine finding niche university lectures, educational talks, and insightful material that’s often buried deep in the platform. Our goal is to help students, teachers, educators, and knowledge seekers everywhere access these hidden gems.

YouTube hosts an incredible wealth of content that often goes unseen, and we’re here to help liberate it. let me know if this already exits too please.

Join us on this journey—if you’re a coder, a creator, or just someone passionate about empowering discovery, your contributions and enthusiasm are welcome. Together, we can build tools that give control back to creators and their communities.

Lastly I'm open to all ideas and would love a fair way to reward collaboration, i just dont know yet what that looks like. Hopefully someone who sees this does.
